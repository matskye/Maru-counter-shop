# Maru-counter-shop
A fun little game to practice your Japanese counters

A browser-based game for practicing **Japanese counters**.
Players serve customers in Maru’s shop by dragging the right number of items to the counter.
Requests are spoken aloud in Japanese (TTS) and support irregular counter readings (e.g. いっぴき, はっぽん).

### What's new

- Added practice sets for **缶 (かん)**, **袋 (ふくろ)**, and **球 (きゅう)** so you can now count canned drinks, bags, and sports balls alongside the existing counters.
